Destiny-Style Weapon Perk Roll Simulator

I originally created this program for fun, in 2018.
My goal was to simulate a system for rolling random perks on weapons in a First Person Shooter, because I had become frustrated over the state of he game Destiny 2 and its lack of randomly rolled perks on weapons and armor.
Now, in 2022, I've decided to go back over my program and re-write it.
Below is my original description.

I'm creating this app in order to personally see just how difficult it is (in theory) to implement random weapon rolls into a game like Destiny.
I'm doing this because the lack of weapon rolls is one of my main points of frustration with Destiny 2, and I'm curious about what kind of work it takes to program that type of system.
